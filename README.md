# [Raycasting-Visualization-in-3D]

- This program has been developed to simulate raycasting algorithmic process in 2D and 3D virtual spaces.
- 
- Some of the mathematical principles used to visualize the simulation are as follows:
> [1] Computation of line-to-line interception point --> iteratively updates the interception points to derive the perception of "bright" and "dark" regions using line segments called "rays" emerging from the "light source". \
> [2] Heuristic method used to map raycasting phenomena into 3D perspective. 

- Use mouse to move the light source around the screen (within the 2D section).
- Use A or D keys to rotate the light source.
- Use X key to quit.
