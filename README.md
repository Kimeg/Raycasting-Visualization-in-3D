# [Raycasting-Visualization-in-3D]

### This program has been developed to simulate ray-casting algorithmic process in 2D and pseudo-3D spaces.

#### Ray-casting is one of the computer graphics rendering methods that uses rays (vectors) to detect intended target objects within designated virtual environment.
#### Although conventional methods utilize discretized intervals to detect objects along the ray's trajectory, this program searches for ray's intersecting points and computes the nearest one from itself. The purpose of searching for the nearest intersection point is to render only parts of the ray from the light source upto the point of intersection, thereby demonstrating the perception of shades. 

### Some of the mathematical principles used to visualize the simulation are as follows:
> [1] Computation of line-to-line interception point --> iteratively updates the interception points to derive the perception of "bright" and "dark" regions using line segments called "rays" emerging from the "light source". \
> [2] Heuristic method used to map raycasting phenomena into 3D perspective. 

- Use mouse to move the light source around the screen (within the 2D section).
- Use A or D keys to rotate the light source.
- Use X key to quit.
